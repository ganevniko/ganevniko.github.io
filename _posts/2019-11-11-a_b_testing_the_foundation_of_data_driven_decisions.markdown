At a high level it is a statistical way to compare two or more versions of the same product, service or tool to determine which version performs better but also to determine if there is really a difference between the two versions when it comes to your target metric, for example Click Through Rate (CTR).

<b>When should you run an A/B test? </b> The answer is pretty much all the time. Every time you implement a change or a new feature, product, color…you can test to see if it makes a difference and if this difference is what you expected. 

<b>Why do business conduct A/B test? </b>A common dilemma a business faces is to understand the customer, and customers can behave in very unexpected ways. For example, you may compare two different layouts of your website or newsletters you send to customers and collect data on the way customers react to this different versions. You can then run A/B testing and determine if you should switch to the new alternative or preserve you previous approach. 
The first step is to pick the criteria for success and divide your customers into a group you present with one version of the product or website and another group with the second version. It is not necessary to present a product you are testing to 50% of tour customers as this may harm your business, you just need to make sure you have tested it on enough customers for the results to be statistically significant. 

Once you have picked your criteria for success you have to divide your customers into two groups. The first group is presented with one version of the product or website and the second group with the second version. It is not necessary to present a product you are testing to 50% of tour customers as this may harm your business, you just need to make sure you have tested it on enough customers for the results to be statistically significant. 

<b>Also, how do you know that your test is reliable?</b> Some organization practice an A/A test before jumping into A/B testing. The A/A test can be seen as a sanity check before running A/B testing and can prove to be very valuable in making sure that you’re A/B test is reliable and it was run in a proper context. The indicator of success is that the A/A test shows there is no difference between the two groups that were tested with the same version of the product.
