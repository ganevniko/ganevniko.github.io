***“The world will be divided between those who tell machines what to do and those who are told by machines”***
 
More and more tasks are getting automated and an increasing number of jobs are threatened to be replaced by machines and software. I am not somebody who is afraid that he will lose his job to a machine but even if I am currently working in wealth management, I clearly see how many of the tasks I do on a daily basis can easily be automated and done by a computer or a SIRI/ ALEXA type of application, probably even better than I do it myself. Machines don’t get tired or need sleep, don’t get sick, don’t get distracted and don’t have emotions which, let’s be honest, are all factors that negatively impact performance at work even if they are the essence of us being human. So what is it that still makes humans more valuable than AI? For me it is the fact that every machine or AI algorithm is created by humans and the best way to ride the wave of the internet of things and all the data collected by the exponentially growing number of sensors and other data sources is to be on the side of those who create the machines and the AI algorithms that control them. It turns out that machines are as efficient as they are because all their decision are data driven and a lot of companies are getting into using this concept to improve their bottom line.  As data-driven decisions become more and more commonplace all around the world, the best way I have found to contribute to this new industrial revolution is as a data scientist. And there are many aspects of the field that I think are fascinating.

First there is no doubt the need for data scientists is growing at an out of the charts rate. And it is not surprising. In twenty years only, the world went from a state where a landline was the only window to the world for the entire household, to a state where every single person is connected to the entire world in a multitude of different ways through all kinds of devices and applications: social media, cell phones with geolocation, smart personal objects like watches, smart medical devices...The amount of data each person produces everyday has grown to numbers that are hard to imagine. Studies show that globally we produce 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily. I honestly am not sure how many zeros exactly one quintillion has but the point is that storing this quantity of data comes at a cost for companies who own it (do they really own is another question for another day), and the data has to be used to improve business, otherwise there is no pint of keeping the data, and this is where the data scientist comes in!

That leads me to my second fascinating point about being a data scientist: every time you start on a new project or a new company you could be exposed to a whole new world. Data science provides exposure to so many fields. The power of the data scientist is that, provided a sufficient amount of data, he turns into a specialist of the field through his AI models. When sent in a new company the data scientist collects information from the team and the database, and in a fairly short period of time he will be giving valuable advice to veterans of the industry on how to run their business. Not too long ago who would have thought of suggesting to startups, small business owners or even large multinational companies to hire somebody who knows little to nothing about their core business so that he can help advise them on how to improve it? In my opinion this is the real strength of the data scientist; data driven decisions are as good as, if not better than, decisions taken by somebody with decades of experience in the industry. You need to expand your company to a completely new line of products or services? No need to hire experts in the field, just provide enough data (not always free) to your data scientist and he will help you make the right moves, pick the right products, generate reliable models for the outcomes of your mew enterprise. 

To sum up, data science is here to stay and it is an extremely rich, diverse and fascinating field which explains why I want to be in data science, but why do I think that I can make it ? IBM statistics from 2017 predict a 28% increase in data scientists demand by 2020 and expect most of these openings to be in the finance and insurance field. I am lucky enough to have a master degree in finance as well as a CFA which already makes me somebody who is comfortable around numbers and able to extract trends and concepts out of data. Also, between the programming, modelling and statistical skills I have acquired at Flatiron and my finance knowledge I am trying to position myself as a bridge element between the technical world and the business side as I  speak both languages.
